# Betti Number Calculator and Bakry-Émery curvature

A Python library for computing the first Betti number of a cell complex derived from a graph by attaching 2-cells to every 3-, 4-, and 5-cycle. It also includes an efficient Python implementation of Bakry-Émery curvature for graphs. To compute only the Bakry-Émery curvature without, set init_two_cells to False.
